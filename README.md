Statistics app for introductory biology students

An R-based web-tool developed using Shiny that allows introductory biology (or other natural sciences) students to upload their own data, calculate summary statistics, make box and scatter plots, and conduct common statistical tests. Tests include:

        Pearson correlation

                Spearman rank correlation
                two-sample t-test (paired and unpaired designs)

MWU test (paired and unpaired designs)

ANOVA (with Tukey post-hoc test)

Kruskal-Wallis (with Dunn post-hoc test)

Fisher's exact test

Chi-squared test


The webpage is scaffolded into three Levels for reduce cognitive load in introductory classes, with different levels introduced in subsequent labs/classes. Level 0 has not been deployed in a class but has been added here as an alternative starting point. Summary of differences between levels:

Level 0 is the basic webpage with summary statisics, a t-test, and Pearson correlation;

Level 1 adds non-parametric options (MWU and Spearman rank correlation) and optional R coding instructions;

Level 2 adds ANOVA and KW;

Level 3 adds paired and unpaired t-test and MWU designs, and Fisher's exact and Chi-squared tests.
